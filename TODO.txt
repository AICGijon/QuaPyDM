Add NAE, NRAE
Add "measures for evaluating ordinal"?
Document methods with paper references
The parallel training in svmperf seems not to work (not sure...)
In binary quantification (hp, kindle, imdb) we used F1 in the minority class (which in kindle and hp happens to be the
negative class). This is not covered in this new implementation, in which the binary case is not treated as such, but as
an instance of single-label with 2 labels. Check
Add classnames to LabelledCollection ?
Check the overhead in OneVsAll for SVMperf-based (?)
Add HDy to QuaNet? if so, wrap HDy into OneVsAll in case the dataset is not binary.
Plots (one for binary -- the "diagonal", or for a specific class), another for the error as a funcition of drift.
Add datasets for topic.
Add other methods
Clarify whether QuaNet is an aggregative method or not.
Add datasets from Pérez-Gallego et al. 2017, 2019
Add ensemble models from Pérez-Gallego et al. 2017, 2019
Add plots models like those in Pérez-Gallego et al. 2017 (error boxes)
Add support for CV prediction in ACC and PACC for tpr, fpr
Add medium swap method
Explore the hyperparameter "number of bins" in HDy
Implement HDy for single-label?
Rename EMQ to SLD ?
How many times is the system of equations for ACC and PACC not solved? How many times is it clipped? Do they sum up
    to one always?
Parallelize the kFCV in ACC and PACC
